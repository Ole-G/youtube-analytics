# YouTube Channel Analytics Automation Tool

## Overview
This Google Apps Script solution automates the collection and analysis of YouTube channel metrics, designed specifically for influencer marketing and content creator analysis. The tool leverages YouTube's Data API v3 to extract comprehensive channel analytics and presents them in an organized Google Sheets format, enabling efficient influencer discovery and evaluation.

## Core Functionality
The script transforms manual influencer research into an automated process by providing:

1. Automated Channel Information Extraction
   - Converts various YouTube URL formats into standardized channel IDs
   - Retrieves fundamental channel metrics (subscribers, views, video count)
   - Extracts engagement metrics (average comment count, video duration)
   - Captures demographic information (country, creation date)
   - Collects contact information (email, Telegram) from channel descriptions

2. Data Quality Management
   - Implements duplicate detection and highlighting
   - Validates channel URLs and data integrity
   - Maintains data consistency across different URL formats
   - Provides visual feedback for data validation

3. User Interface Integration
   - Checkbox-triggered data collection
   - Progress indicators via toast notifications
   - Automatic formula management
   - Visual duplicate highlighting for easy identification

## Technical Implementation

### URL Processing and Channel Identification
The script handles multiple YouTube URL formats:
```javascript
function GetYouTubeID(url) {
    // Supports channel URLs (/channel/ID)
    // Handles custom URLs (@username)
    // Processes channel handles
    // Falls back to search-based identification
}
```

### API Integration
The tool makes efficient use of YouTube Data API endpoints:
- Channels API for basic metrics and branding
